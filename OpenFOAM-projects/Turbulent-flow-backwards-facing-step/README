The boundary layer separation of turbulent flow and its subsequent reattachment is investigated.
This, in fact, happens in several engineering applications such as airfoils and channels.
Since Turbulence plays a crucial role in the reattachment process,
it is indeed important that turbulence models can accurately model the impact of turbulence in this flow.
As such, in this assignment, different popular turbulence models are considered
and the results of the simulation are compared to benchmark experimental ones in [1].

The computational domain is shown in Fig. Backwards-facing-step.PNG:

The uniform turbulent flow enters a duct of height h = 25.4 [mm] and length h with a uniform inlet velocity (U_0) of 10 [m/s],
and flows over a backwards-facing step with height h. Separation and reattachment occurs in the second duct of height 2h and length 8.11h.
A slight constriction occurs downstream of the second duct to ensure that the flow reattaches upstream of the outlet boundary.
What’s more, the flow is unsteady, Newtonian, and incompressible.
The outlet static pressure is set to 10 [Pa] gauge. The inlet Reynolds number is 25400, which helps us define the kinematic viscosity for OpenFOAM.
The turbulence is modelled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS).
The inlet turbulence intensity is equal to I=0.05U_0 and the inlet turbulence length scale is l=0.055h. Also, the fluid’s density (ρ) is 1 [kg/m^3 ].
Four different turbulence models of Spalart-Allmaras, k-ϵ, k-ω, and k-ω shear stress transport (SST) are considered.
In order to generate the mesh domain, blockMesh is used through OpenFOAM. The solver for this simulation is simpleFOAM.

In order to calculate k, the following expression is used:

k=  3/2 (UI^2 )=0.375 m^2/s^2 

Using an empirically-based estimation, boundary condition for the dissipation rate (ϵ) is as follows:

ϵ≈C_μ  k^(3/2)/l

In which, l is the length scale of the inlet turbulence and C_μ=0.09 is a model constant.
This results in ϵ=14.855  m^2/s^3 . Moreover, the boundary conditions for the specific dissipation rate (ω) is approximated from

ω=√k/l=440.15s^(-1)
