The subsonic flow over NACA 5012 airfoil is investigated in this study (Fig. Flow-across-NACA5012.PNG).
Two different Reynolds numbers of 100 and 1000 are considered.
The approaching velocity to the airfoil, i.e. free stream velocity, has zero angle of attack and equals to 1 [m/s].
The airfoil chord is unit length (c = 1), so Reynolds number (Re=  Uc/ν) can be manipulated by changing the kinematic viscosity’s value.
Fluid properties are constant, the initial gauge pressure is 0 [Pa], and the flow is both laminar and incompressible.
In order to generate the mesh, GMSH software is used, and then, the generated mesh is converted to OpenFOAM readable mesh file,
i.e. blockMesh, using gmshToFoam command.
To reduce and optimize the costs of the study, a mesh refinement study is conducted.
The overall running time for mesh refinement study is considered to be 20 [s] for all of the cases of Re = 100 and Re = 1000,
since it takes some time for the flow to get stable all over the domain.
