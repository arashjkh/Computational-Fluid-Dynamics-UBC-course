This problem is an axisymmetric converging-diverging nozzle,
in which an inviscid, laminar, steady, non-conducting fluid flows within it (Fig. Converging-diverging-nozzle.png).
The inlet total pressure is equal to a constant value of 10 [kPa].
Accordingly, three different outlet static pressures, corresponding to p_e/p_0 =0.89, p_e/p_0 =0.75, and p_e/p_0 =0.16, are considered.
In fact, different outlet pressures yield different flow types in the nozzle.
The first case results in a subsonic, isentropic flow.
The second case yields a supersonic flow with a normal shock in the diffusing section.
The last case is a supersonic isentropic flow.
In order to accelerate the convergence for the second and the third cases,
in which the flow through the nozzle is chocked and gives rise to sonic conditions,
initial pressure distribution of p_0 = 10 [kPa] for the upstream of the throat and p_0 = 7.5 [kPa] and 1.6 [kPa] are specified for the two cases respectively.
What’s more, the fluid properties are for those of air with a M (molar mass) = 29 kg/kmol; c_p = 1005 J/(kg.K); μ = 0 (inviscid); γ (ratio of specific heats) =1.4;
and Pr = 1. In order to simulate this incompressible flow in OpenFOAM, the rhoCentralFoam command is used.
The entire simulation time is 0.7 [s] and the timestep is taken 0.001 [s].
