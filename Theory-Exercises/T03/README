In this study, the convection of a one-dimensional wave in an inviscid medium is investigated.
This equation is called as inviscid Burgers' equation, which its advective form is expressed as follows:

∂u/∂t+u ∂u/∂x=0    (I)

Its conservation form is also expressed as:

∂u/∂t+∂F/∂x=0;F=u^2/2    (II)

By using three different explicit finite-differencing schemes, i.e. Lax method, Lax-Wendro method, and MacCormack method,
the equation II is solved numerically via Python. The domain has periodic boundary conditions, and the initial condition
for the problem is subjected to (III) in the domain 0 ≤x ≤2π:

u(x, 0) = sin(x) + 0.5 sin(0.5x)    (III)

	The timestep for this problem is taken as ∆t=0.01 [sec].
	Units of x and u are taken to be meter [m] and meter per second [m/s], respectively. Hence, in plots, x and u will be accompanied by [m] and [m/s].
	The courant number (ν) is taken 0.5.
	For determining u_max, the derivative of the (III) is taken to be zero, and the equation is solved to find the value of u, which is, in this case, u_max.
  The value of u_max is 1.31 [m/s].
